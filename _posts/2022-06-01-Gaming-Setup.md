I have been building computers for over 8 years.  My dad was a huge influence on getting into the PC building scene he had built me and my brother a computer to play Starwars Battlefront on when we were young. I started with humble beginnings with my first build back in high school. From there I updgraded parts, bought more monitors, and spent more money as time went on. By the time I was a senior in high school I had a 3 monitor setup with a very mid tier build. Great for the games I played. After working at Six Flags St. Louis as System Admin the first  summer I was in college. I was given a i7 5930k with a Asus Deluxe II motherboard and many other nice pieces of hardware by our boss. I used those parts and my current graphics card at the time a GTX 1070. I used that build for over 4 years after that.

Throughout college I had around the same setup.The cobbled together Six Flags PC and my old gaming PC a i5 4690k and GTX 1050ti acting as my streaming PC to make a pretty nice dual PC stream setup. At that point I started to learn about audio and how better hardware could take my gaming and streaming to the next level.

After college is where I got serious and started spending more money. I took my signing bonus from my new job and got matching monitors, monitor stand, a cardiod mic, audio interface for the mic, digital to analog converter, all the cable management goodies, and a Sennheiser 6xx set of headphones. I got my desk setup in the spare bedroom in my apartment. I got lucky with procuring a desk. It is a wood desk that is about 6 feet wide that I got from my girlfriend's mother's storage unit. It has been great because there is plenty of room for all the monitors and the PC to sit up on it. I also had the opportunity to work from home, so I took an old desk I had, and repurposed it for work from home use. I used old monitors from my pervious setups the Macbook and doc I had gotten from work to make a nice setup for my home office.

After I moved out of the apartment I upgraded all the internals on the PC to a AMD Ryzen 9 5900x, 32 GB of ram, and a RTX 3070 and got the PC setup in my new office at the house. For the full spec list with all of my peripherals check out my [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/tonycannoli1). I am very passionate about PC gaming and the tech that goes with it. I am always trying to stay up to date about the latest trends and hardware.

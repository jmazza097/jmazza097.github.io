In my senior year of College I researched wether smart devices like smart watches could be used to aid the growing
Tele-Health industry. The goal of the paper was to see if these devices could effectively provide additional medical and
health data on patients that would not be accesible in a remote setting. I did this by analyzing the effectiveness of
this technology by surveying medical professionals and making a proof of concept application. To read my paper
